                Greetings, fellow earthling! I’m Ken Takakura, and welcome to my blog dedicated to the occult and the bizarre! Miss Ayase suggested that it would be a fun idea to document all our strange findings in one place. What better way to do that than with a public blog?

                Ever since the Turbo Granny cursed me and snatched my family jewels, 
                all sorts of paranormal and extraterrestrial occurrences have been happening 
                to us. I’ll be sure to report on these experiences and include 
                visual representations of the spirits or 
                aliens that Miss Ayase and I must confront or befriend. Who would've thought starting a blog could be so fun!
            </p>

            <h2 id = "tv_header">Turbo Granny</h2>
            <p id = "tv_info"> I still remember my 
                first encounter with the supernatural, way back when 
                I met Miss Ayase. At the time, I was skeptical about the existence of ghosts; 
                it all seemed so absurd to me. Science could explain most of the phenomena 
                attributed to spirits! So, I made a bet with Miss Ayase: if I could find a 
                spirit, I would become her gofer. We ended up discovering some incredible 
                entities, but one in particular stands out: the Turbo Granny. 
                Also known as the "100 Kilometer Grandma" in Japanese folklore, 
                she had a notorious reputation. Anyone who dared to race her and lost would 
                face dire consequences—she would 
                claim their family jewels. And, well, that's exactly what happened to me... She’s proven to be a formidable opponent, 
                but when she’s on our side, she can actually be quite the softie!</p>

                Ah yes, those were the aliens that attempted to experiment on Miss Ayase. 
                Yes, ALIENS!! While I had always dreamed of encountering extraterrestrial life,
                 these beings were anything but peaceful. They were determined to use 
                 Miss Ayase for their experiments. 
                 At that time, I was possessed by Turbo Granny and was ready to 
                 sacrifice everything just to protect her. When we first met, 
                 she stood up for me, and I knew I couldn’t let them do whatever 
                 they pleased with her. Unfortunately, I was quickly overwhelmed; their 
                 telekinetic abilities were far too strong for us. But in that moment 
                 of desperation, Miss Ayase awakened her own powers and saved us both!
